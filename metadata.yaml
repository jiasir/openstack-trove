  Trove is Database as a Service for Openstack. It's designed to run
  entirely on OpenStack, with the goal of allowing users to quickly and
  easily utilize the features of a relational database without the
  burden of handling complex administrative tasks. Cloud users and
  database administrators can provision and manage multiple database
  instances as needed. Initially, the service will focus on providing
  resource isolation at high performance while automating complex
  administrative tasks including deployment, configuration, patching,
  backups, restores, and monitoring. Trove is designed to support a
  single-tenant database within a Nova instance. There is no
  restrictions on how Nova is configured, since Trove interacts with
  other OpenStack components purely through the API.  This package
  provides the Trove API server. The trove-api service provides a
  RESTful API that supports JSON and XML to provision and manage Trove
  instances.
